# Howdy! ðŸ¤˜

I am a Project Editor and Staff Engineer at The New York Times, within the Interactive News Technology (INT) team within the newsroom. 

My work includes software development, web development, data journalism and occasionally some reporting. Of course this profile centers the nerdy parts of my job.
