# Howdy! ðŸ¤˜

I am a project leader and full-stack newsroom software developer, formerly with The New York Times and msnbc.com (not the cable channel, but close). I now run [Gasworks Data L3C](https://gasworksdata.com/), a small low-profit shop that parners with newsrooms, NGOs and other organizations to complete projects that require tech + editorial expertise.

My news-nerd work includes custom software & web development, data journalism and occasional reporting & editing. Of course this profile centers the nerdy parts of my job.
