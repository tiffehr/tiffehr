# Howdy! 🤘

I am a project leader and full-stack "staff" developer, formerly with The New York Times and msnbc.com (not the cable channel, but close). 

My news-nerd work includes custom software & web development, data journalism and occasional reporting & editing. Of course this profile centers the nerdy parts of my job.
